      <description>Subjects -Prerequisites
-Choose your website
-Recon/Hacking
-Writeup
-Resources
Prerequisites Mindset So you want to get into bug bounty? Great, but I highly recommend you come in with this mindset: Be positive, be persistent and play the waiting game.
Operating Systems Now let&#39;s pick an operating system:
-Linux
-macOS
-Windows
Any of these should do, I would personally not recommend trying to do bug bounty on chromeOS as a lot of your tools would be browser plugins and if you&#39;re still new to cybersecurity you&#39;re just making your transition into this field a lot harder unfortunately.</description>
