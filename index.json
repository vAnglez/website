An aspiring red teamer currently residing in Las Vegas, previously a Cybersecurity Intern for an MSSP \u0026amp; Cybersecurity Researcher under the NNSA. Currently I work as the Junior Member Coordinator for my non-profit (Free Cyber Clinic) where we provide training material for subjects such as OSINT, Network Security, Infrastructure, and etc in order to have our members perform security assessments and remediations for small businesses. Outside of the Free Cyber Clinic I provide training and mentorship to students looking to get into cybersecurity or decide on a career.\nWant to contact me?

Great, but I highly recommend you come in with this mindset: Be positive, be persistent, and play the waiting game.\nOperating Systems Now let's pick an operating system:\nLinux macOS Windows Any of these should do. I would personally not recommend trying to do bug bounty on ChromeOS, as many of your tools would be browser plugins. If you're still new to cybersecurity, you're just making your transition into this field a lot harder, unfortunately.\nTools With any of the previous operating systems, you want to go ahead and install either OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite as you'll need a proxy to intercept requests being made to your target website. The Community Edition (free version) of Burp Suite is perfectly fine for just starting, and if you want some of those premium features, then perhaps try OWASP ZAP or consider buying Burp Suite Professional.\nNow that you have a proxy, you can decide if you want to use the built-in browser that comes with ZAP/Burp. But if you want to use your own browser, then you'll have to get something like FoxyProxy. More information on how to install can be found here: SETTING UP BURP SUITE.\nWith all the proxy stuff figured out, let's move on to handy tools while doing bug bounty:\nCookie Editor: Used for editing values attached to cookies Wappalyzer: Version and service check for the whole web app instead of having to manually find them Note Taking With all technical tools out of the way, now we move on to one of the most important things in cybersecurity: DOCUMENTATION. Find a note-taking app that fits you best, but make sure to take as many notes as you can when learning or testing out anything for web applications, as you'll never know when those notes may come in clutch.\nNote Taking Apps:\nJoplin OneNote Cherry Tree Evernote Kate Text Editors:\nVisual Studio Code Vim Notepad++ etc. Choose Your Website Now that you have set up your device for bug bounty, let's find the right website for you. To familiarize yourself with bug bounty terms, consider the following:\nPlatform: The websites providing links and access to their partners' VDPs, as well as triaging Triage: The process of remediating or reviewing bug bounty reports to decide on the appropriate action to take Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP): The process that accepts, fixes, and discloses bug bounties Disclosure: Allowing bug bounty hunters to post write-ups or speak publicly about the bugs they found Now, there are numerous ways to choose a website, but personally, I believe it's best to view disclosures. If it feels like you would work well with their team, then try that company's VDP. Here are some platforms to try out:\nHackerOne BugCrowd Intigriti Requires Application:\nSynack Cobalt If you feel like you're a boss at bug bounty, then perhaps you may want to consider VDPs directly from companies like Google, Facebook, Apple \u0026 Medium. If you feel the opposite, then consider perhaps opening up a VDP for a website you use a ton. But tread with caution, as they may ask if you have a bug, and if you go beyond their non-existent rules of engagement (ROE), they might get mad and get you in trouble LOL.\nRecon/Hacking Reconnaissance You've picked your website, but now you need to get more information about them. Personally, I'm very much a visual person, so I like to build out a tree representing the website's layout \u0026 structure:\nWebsite Domain Subdomains Directories Input/Output Fields Buttons Etc. Once I have an idea of what's laid out, I can mark this tree to keep track of what sections of the website I have tested and document how I've tested it in our notes. If you're looking for an easier win, then some good tools to use would be Shodan, Google, and Wappalyzer to check for keywords or versions that would show a CWE or CVE.\nHacking With all that information, you should now have some sort of target narrowed down from the scope given and the tree we created. Common weaknesses to look for in a web application can be referenced here: OWASP Top 10 2021. If the OWASP Top 10 doesn't seem to lead you anywhere, then try web app checklists provided by other bug bounty hunters online. After everything, if nothing is sticking, then you have two options:\nYou just need to learn a little more, so study and find your niche in bug bounty to make that money. Try a different website; sometimes some bounty programs just have skilled engineers or strict triagers. NOW, whatever you do, please don't follow these tips: meme. Stick to the rules of engagement, or else: JAIL TIME or some really fat fines LOL.\nWriteup So you found a bug on a website? Great, let's get into what sort of content your writeup should have.\nExploit Title Exploit, domain \u0026 impact in a sentence Summary of Exploit Breakdown the exploit into a paragraph Severity Define severity (Tools: CVSS / H1 Rating) Reproduce Vulnerability Like a summary, except basically a walk-through Proof of Concept Video, pictures, or scripts to reproduce exploit Impact Describe how it would affect a client or company (VERY IMPORTANT) Solution Do you know why the vulnerability exists, drop a suggestion (Optional) Once you finish those sections for your report, then go ahead and review it with a friend or by yourself and compare it with previous disclosures from that bug bounty program to ensure the best chance of your bug being accepted.\nResources Now you're officially a bug bounty hunter, at least in my eyes :))\nIf you feel like you need more resources to get better at bug bounty, then here are some tips \u0026 resources!\nLearning Platforms: Port Swigger Academy Hacker101 (can get you into private programs for HackerOne) TryHackMe HackTheBox Content Creators: NahamSec The XSS RAT PwnFunction Books: Bug Bounty Bootcamp The Tangled Web (more so for code review, but a great resource regardless) ","link":"/blog/bugbounty/","section":"blog","title":"Introduction into Bug Bounty"},{"body":"Resume/CV Angel Garcia J.\nProfessional Development\nCertifications: Security+, A+, LPI Linux Essentials\nHomelab: Proxmox | Windows Server 2022 | Ubuntu Server with Docker | pfSense | Cloudflare\nConferences:\nBSides Las Vegas 2022, 2023 CES 2023 DEFCON 29, 30, 31 DOE Cybercon 2022, 2023 CTFs:\nBoss of the Soc 2023 25th/60 Teams -
