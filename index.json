I am currently looking for full-time work in either Cybersecurity or Networking.\nI currently reside in Las Vegas and work as a Training Program Developer for my non-profit (Free Cyber Clinic) where we provide training material for subjects such as OSINT, Network Security, Infrastructure, and etc in order to have our members perform assessments and remediation for small businesses. Outside of the Free Cyber Clinic I provides training and mentorship to students looking to get into cybersecurity or decide on a career.\nWant to contact me?

Great, but I highly recommend you come in with this mindset: Be positive, be persistent and play the waiting game.\nOperating Systems Now let's pick an operating system:\n-Linux\n-macOS\n-Windows\nAny of these should do, I would personally not recommend trying to do bug bounty on chromeOS as a lot of your tools would be browser plugins and if you're still new to cybersecurity you're just making your transition into this field a lot harder unfortunately.\nTools With any of the previous operating systems you want to go ahead and install either OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite as you'll need a proxy to intercept requests being made to your target website. Community Edition(free version) for Burp Suite is perfectly fine for just starting and if want some of those premium features then perhaps try OWASP ZAP or if you feel like it is worth then buy Burp Suite Professional.\nNow that you got a proxy, you can decide if you want to use the built-on browser that comes with ZAP/Burp but if you want to use your own browser then you'll have to get something like FoxyProxy. More information on how to install can be found here: SETTING UP BURP SUITE.\nWith all proxy stuff figured out, let's move onto handy tools while doing bug bounty:\n-Cookie Editor: Used for editing values attached to cookies\n-Wappalyzer: Version and Service check for the whole web app instead of having to manually finding them\nNote Taking With all technical tools out of the way, now we move onto one of the most important things in cybersecurity: DOCUMENTATION. Find a note taking app that fits you best but make sure to take as many notes as you can when learning or testing out anything for web applications as you'll never know when those notes may come clutch.\nNote Taking Apps:\n-Joplin / OneNote / Cherry Tree / Evernote / Kate\nText Editors:\n-Visual Studio Code / Vim / Notepad++ / etc.\nChoose your website Now that you setup your device to do some bug bounty, let's find the right website for you. So some terms to get familiar with when considering bug bounty are:\n-Platform: The websites providing you links and access to to their partners' VDPs as well as triaging\n-Triage: To remediate or read your bug bounty reports to decide on the appropriate action to take\n-Vulnerability Disclosure Program(VDP): The proccess that accepts, fixes and discloses bug bounties\n-Disclosure: Allowing bug bounty hunters to post write ups or speak publicly about the bug they found\nNow, there are a ton of ways to decide a website but personally I belive it's best to just view disclosures and if it feels like you would work well with their team then try that company's VDP. With that said here are some platforms to try out:\n-HackerOne\n-BugCrowd\n-Intigriti\nRequire Application:\n-Synack\n-Cobalt\nNow if you feel like you're a boss at bug bounty then perhaps you may want to consider VDPs directly from companies like Google, Facebook, Apple \u0026amp; Medium. If you feel the opposite, then consider perhaps opening up a VDP for a website you use a ton but tread with caution as they may ask if you have a bug and if you went pass their non-existent rules of engagement(ROE) they might get mad and get you in trouble LOL.\nRecon/Hacking Reconnaissance You picked your website but now you need to get more information about them. Personally I'm very much a visual person so I like to build out a tree represnting the website's layout \u0026amp; structure:\n-Website Domain\n--Subdomains\n---Directories\n----Input/Output Fields\n----Buttons\n----Etc.\nOnce I have an idea of what's laid out I can mark this tree to keep track of what sections of the website I have tested and documenting how I've tested it on our notes. If you're looking for an easier win then some good tools to use would be Shodan, Google \u0026amp; Wappalyzer to check for keywords or versions that would show a CWE or CVE.\nHacking With all that information you should now have some sort of target narrowed down from the scope given and tree we created. Common weaknesses to look for in a web application can be referenced here: OWASP Top 10 2021. If not OWASP Top 10 doesn't seem to lead you anywhere then try web app checklists provided by other bug bounty hunters online. After everything if nothing is sticking then you have 2 options:\n-You just need to learn a little more so study and find your niche in bug bounty to make that money.\n-Try a different website, sometimes some bounty programs just have cracked engineers or strict triagers.\nNOW, whatever you do please don't follow these tips: meme. Stick to the rules of engagement or else: JAIL TIME or some really fat fines LOL.\nWriteup So you found a bug on a website? Great let's get into what sort of content your writeup should have.\nExploit Title\n-Exploit, domain \u0026amp; impact in a sentence Summary of Exploit\n-Breakdown the exploit into a paragraph Severity\n-Define severity (Tools: CVSS / H1 Rating) Reproduce Vulnerability\n-Like summary, except basically a walk-through Proof of Concept\n-Video, pictures or scripts to reproduce exploit Impact\n-Describe how it would affect a client or company(VERY IMPORTANT) Solution\n-Do you know why the vulnerability exists, drop a suggestion(Optional) Once your finish those sections for your report then go ahead and review it with a friend or by yourself and compare with previous disclosures from that bug bounty program to ensure the best chance of your bug being accepted.\nResources Now you're officially a bug bounty hunter, at least in my eyes :))\nIf you feel like you need more resources to get better at bug bounty then here are some tips \u0026amp; resources!\nLearning Platforms: Port Swigger Academy, Hacker101(can get you into private programs for hackerone), TryHackMe, HackTheBox\nContent Creators: NahamSec, The XSS RAT, PwnFunction\nBooks: Bug Bounty Bootcamp,The Tangled Web(more so for code review, but great resourece regardless)\n","link":"/blog/bugbounty/","section":"blog","title":"Introduction into Bug Bounty"},{"body":"Resume/CV Angel Garcia J.\n702-960-9278\nangel.garcia0616@icloud.com\nCompany Role Time Period\rContract Work\rSystems Administrator\rMay 2022 - Now\rAdminister virtual machines \u0026 update services provided to 100+ users to strive for 99.999% uptime\rCreate and revise internal documentation for networks, infrastructure \u0026 assets in order to minimize cost from wasted time \u0026 resources\rManage projects through Jira \u0026 Asana to keep business operating on a weekly basis\rClients: Free Cyber Clinic, Layer Zero \u0026 Personal Homelab\rFree Cyber Clinic\rTraining Program Developer \u0026 Co-Founder\rOctober 2021 - Now\rNon-profit that assess threat actor Tactics, Techniques \u0026 Procedures (TTPs) focused on the 100s of small businesses under the SBDC to help prevent $100,000+ of damages from hacks \u0026 breaches.\rCreate virtual labs to be assessed with open-source \u0026 system tools to train for vulnerabilities or weaknesses found in small businesses.\rLayout \u0026 create additional training material for certifications like the Security+ in order to allow our 40+ students to work and lessen that workforce gap of millions of people.\rNNSA MSIPP\rSecurity Researcher\rSeptember 2022 - Jan 2023\rCreate datasets with tools like Havoc - C2 Framework, Wireshark / TCPDump, VMware Workstation Pro \u0026 self-made tools/programs to recreate attacks from Advanced Persistent Threats(APTs).\rImplement machine learning on network data from IOT, SCADA, \u0026 ICS devices with Python to discover methods to detect Advanced Persistent Threats without the need of costly EDRs.
